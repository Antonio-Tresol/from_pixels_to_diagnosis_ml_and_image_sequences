  abstract={BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Early haematoma expansion is determinative in predicting outcome of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) patients. The aims of this study are to develop a novel prediction model for haematoma expansion by applying deep learning model and validate its prediction accuracy. METHODS: Data of this study were obtained from a prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with primary supratentorial ICH from our centre. We developed a deep learning model to predict haematoma expansion and compared its performance with conventional non-contrast CT (NCCT) markers. To evaluate the predictability of this model, it was also compared with a logistic regression model based on haematoma volume or the BAT score. RESULTS: A total of 266 patients were finally included for analysis, and 74 (27.8%) of them experienced early haematoma expansion. The deep learning model exhibited highest C statistic as 0.80, compared with 0.64, 0.65, 0.51, 0.58 and 0.55 for hypodensities, black hole sign, blend sign, fluid level and irregular shape, respectively. While the C statistics for swirl sign (0.70; p=0.211) and heterogenous density (0.70; p=0.141) were not significantly higher than that of the deep learning model. Moreover, the predictive value for the deep learning model was significantly superior to that of the logistic model of haematoma volume (0.62; p=0.042) and the BAT score (0.65; p=0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the conventional NCCT markers and BAT predictive model, the deep learning algorithm showed superiority for predicting early haematoma expansion in ICH patients.},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Automated brain hematoma segmentation and outcome prediction for patients with TBI can effectively facilitate patient management. In this study, we propose a novel Multi-view convolutional neural network with a mixed loss to segment total acute hematoma on head CT scans collected within 24 h after the injury. Based on the automated segmentation, the volumetric distribution and shape characteristics of the hematoma were extracted and combined with other clinical observations to predict 6-month mortality. The proposed hematoma segmentation network achieved an average Dice coefficient of 0.697 and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.966 between the volumes estimated from the predicted hematoma segmentation and volumes of the annotated hematoma segmentation on the test set. Compared with other published methods, the proposed method has the most accurate segmentation performance and volume estimation. For 6-month mortality prediction, the model achieved an average area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) of 0.559 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.853 using 10-fold cross-validation on a dataset consisting of 828 patients. The average AUCPR and AUC of the proposed model are respectively more than 10% and 5% higher than those of the widely used IMPACT model.}

abstract = {Hemorrhagic stroke is the condition involving the rupture of a vessel inside the brain and is characterized by high mortality rates. Even if the patient survives, stroke can cause temporary or permanent disability depending on how long blood flow has been interrupted. Therefore, it is crucial to act fast to prevent irreversible damage. In this work, a deep learning-based approach to automatically segment hemorrhagic stroke lesions in CT scans is proposed. Our approach is based on a 3D U-Net architecture which incorporates the recently proposed squeeze-and-excitation blocks. Moreover, a restrictive patch sampling is proposed to alleviate the class imbalance problem and also to deal with the issue of intra-ventricular hemorrhage, which has not been considered as a stroke lesion in our study. Moreover, we also analyzed the effect of patch size, the use of different modalities, data augmentation and the incorporation of different loss functions on the segmentation results. All analyses have been performed using a five fold cross-validation strategy on a clinical dataset composed of 76 cases. Obtained results demonstrate that the introduction of squeeze-and-excitation blocks, together with the restrictive patch sampling and symmetric modality augmentation, significantly improved the obtained results, achieving a mean DSC of 0.86±0.074, showing promising automated segmentation results.}

abstract = {The computation of hematoma volume is the key parameter for treatment planning of Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) imaging is routinely used for the diagnosis of ICH. Hence, the development of computer-aided tools for three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) image analysis is essential to estimate the gross volume of hematoma. We propose a methodology for automatic estimation of the hematoma volume from 3D CT volumes. Our approach integrates two different methods, multiple abstract splitting (MAS) and seeded region growing (SRG) to develop a unified hematoma detection pipeline from pre-processed CT volumes. The proposed methodology was tested on 80 cases. The volume was estimated from the delineated hematoma region, validated against the ground-truth volumes, and compared with those obtained from the conventional ABC/2 approach. We also compared our results with the U-Net model (supervised technique) to show the applicability of the proposed method. The volume calculated from manually segmented hematoma was considered the ground truth. The R 2 correlation coefficient between the volume obtained from the proposed algorithm and the ground truth is 0.86, which is equivalent to the R 2 value resulting from the comparison between the volume calculated by ABC/2 and the ground truth. The experimental results of the proposed unsupervised approach are comparable to the deep neural architecture (U-Net models). The average computation time was 132.76 ± 14 seconds. The proposed methodology provides a fast and automatic estimation of hematoma volume, which is similar to the baseline user-guided ABC/2 approach. Implementation of our method does not demand a high-end computational setup. Thus, recommended in clinical practice for computer-assistive volume estimation of hematoma from 3D CT volumes and can be implemented in a simple computer system.}

Current state-of-the-art methods for identifying the view computationally involve 2-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but these merely classify individual frames of a video in isolation, and ignore information describing the movement of structures throughout the cardiac cycle. Here we explore the efficacy of novel CNN architectures, including time-distributed networks and two-stream networks, which are inspired by advances in human action recognition. We demonstrate that these new architectures more than halve the error rate of traditional CNNs from 8.1% to 3.9%. These advances in accuracy may be due to these networks’ ability to track the movement of specific structures such as heart valves throughout the cardiac cycle. Finally, we show the accuracies of these new state-of-the-art networks are approaching expert agreement (3.6% discordance), with a similar pattern of discordance between views.},

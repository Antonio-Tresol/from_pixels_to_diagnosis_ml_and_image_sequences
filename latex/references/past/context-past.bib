% Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in the world, the epidemiology of which has changed within last decades. A trend of steady decline in gastric cancer incidence rates is the effect of the increased standards of hygiene, conscious nutrition, and Helicobacter pylori eradication, which together constitute primary prevention. Avoidance of gastric cancer remains a priority. However, patients with higher risk should be screened for early detection and chemoprevention. Surgical resection enhanced by standardized lymphadenectomy remains the gold standard in gastric cancer therapy. This review briefly summarizes the most important aspects of gastric cancers, which include epidemiology, risk factors, classification, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The paper is mostly addressed to physicians who are interested in updating the state of art concerning gastric carcinoma from easily accessible and credible source. (Added by Kenneth)

% Gastric cancer is a major health burden worldwide. It is the second cause of cancer deaths after lung cancer.1,2 More than 90% of the tumors are adenocarcinomas, the main focus of this review. The prognosis is dismal, with an average 5-year survival rate of less than 20%, mainly because of late diagnosis, because the early stages are clinically silent. Only a few countries, especially Japan, have set up extensive programs of early detection. If the tumor is detected and treated before it invades the muscular layer of the stomach, the 5-year survival rate can reach 90%.3 The highest incidence rates are reported for East Asia (Korea, Mongolia, Japan, and China) with annual incidence rates between 40 and 60 per 100,000 inhabitants. In Latin America, pockets of high risk are reported in the Andes Mountains, with rates between 20 and 30 per 100,000,1 in contrast to the much lower rates reported for the coastal and river valley regions.4 Lower rates are found in Africa (~0.3 to 3 per 100,000, and in affluent populations of North America). The incidence rate in African Americans is about double that seen in white American. In general, the incidence rate for men is double that for women. (Added by Kenneth)

abstract = {Purpose
To determine the feasibility of texture analysis for the classification of gastric adenocarcinoma, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors on contrast-enhanced hydrodynamic-MDCT images.
Materials and methods
The arterial phase scans of 47 patients with adenocarcinoma (AC) and a histologic tumor grade of [AC-G1, n=4, G1, n=4; AC-G2, n=7; AC-G3, n=16]; GIST, n=15; and lymphoma, n=5, and the venous phase scans of 48 patients with AC-G1, n=3; AC-G2, n=6; AC-G3, n=14; GIST, n=17; lymphoma, n=8, were retrospectively reviewed. Based on regions of interest, texture analysis was performed, and features derived from the gray-level histogram, run-length and co-occurrence matrix, absolute gradient, autoregressive model, and wavelet transform were calculated. Fisher coefficients, probability of classification error, average correlation coefficients, and mutual information coefficients were used to create combinations of texture features that were optimized for tumor differentiation. Linear discriminant analysis in combination with a k-nearest neighbor classifier was used for tumor classification.
Results
On arterial-phase scans, texture-based lesion classification was highly successful in differentiating between AC and lymphoma, and GIST and lymphoma, with misclassification rates of 3.1% and 0%, respectively. On venous-phase scans, texture-based classification was slightly less successful for AC vs. lymphoma (9.7% misclassification) and GIST vs. lymphoma (8% misclassification), but enabled the differentiation between AC and GIST (10% misclassification), and between the different grades of AC (4.4% misclassification). No texture feature combination was able to adequately distinguish between all three tumor types.
Conclusion
Classification of different gastric tumors based on textural information may aid radiologists in establishing the correct diagnosis, at least in cases where the differential diagnosis can be narrowed down to two histological subtypes.}

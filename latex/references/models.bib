% We present a convolution-free approach to video classification built exclusively on self-attention over space and time. Our method, named "TimeSformer," adapts the standard Transformer architecture to video by enabling spatiotemporal feature learning directly from a sequence of frame-level patches. Our experimental study compares different self-attention schemes and suggests that "divided attention," where temporal attention and spatial attention are separately applied within each block, leads to the best video classification accuracy among the design choices considered. Despite the radically new design, TimeSformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several action recognition benchmarks, including the best reported accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600. Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks, our model is faster to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test efficiency (at a small drop in accuracy), and it can also be applied to much longer video clips (over one minute long) https://github.com/facebookresearch/TimeSformer (added by Antonio)

%We present pure-transformer based models for video classification, drawing upon the recent success of such models in image classification. Our model extracts spatio-temporal tokens from the input video, which are then encoded by a series of transformer layers. In order to handle the long sequences of tokens encountered in video, we propose several, efficient variants of our model which factorise the spatial- and temporal-dimensions of the input. Although transformer-based models are known to only be effective when large training datasets are available, we show how we can effectively regularise the model during training and leverage pretrained image models to be able to train on comparatively small datasets. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple video classification benchmarks including Kinetics 400 and 600, Epic Kitchens, Something-Something v2 and Moments in Time, outperforming prior methods based on deep 3D convolutional networks.

%traditional deep learning approaches for breast cancer classification has predominantly concentrated on single-view analysis. In clinical practice, however, radiologists concurrently examine all views within a mammography exam, leveraging the inherent correlations in these views to effectively detect tumors. Acknowledging the significance of multi-view analysis, some studies have introduced methods that independently process mammogram views, either through distinct convolutional branches or simple fusion strategies, inadvertently leading to a loss of crucial inter-view correlations. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-view network exclusively based on transformers to address challenges in mammographic image classification. Our approach introduces a novel shifted window-based dynamic attention block, facilitating the effective integration of multi-view information and promoting the coherent transfer of this information between views at the spatial feature map level. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance and effectiveness of transformer-based models under diverse settings, employing the CBIS-DDSM and Vin-Dr Mammo datasets.

% Pre-training video transformers on extra large-scale datasets is generally required to achieve premier performance on relatively small datasets. In this paper, we show that video masked autoencoders (VideoMAE) are data-efficient learners for self-supervised video pre-training (SSVP). We are inspired by the recent ImageMAE and propose customized video tube masking with an extremely high ratio. This simple design makes video reconstruction a more challenging self-supervision task, thus encouraging extracting more effective video representations during this pre-training process. We obtain three important findings on SSVP: (1) An extremely high proportion of masking ratio (i.e., 90% to 95%) still yields favorable performance of VideoMAE. The temporally redundant video content enables a higher masking ratio than that of images. (2) VideoMAE achieves impressive results on very small datasets (i.e., around 3k-4k videos) without using any extra data. (3) VideoMAE shows that data quality is more important than data quantity for SSVP. Domain shift between pre-training and target datasets is an important issue. Notably, our VideoMAE with the vanilla ViT can achieve 87.4% on Kinetics-400, 75.4% on Something-Something V2, 91.3% on UCF101, and 62.6% on HMDB51, without using any extra data. (Added by Kenneth)

% Contrastive language-image pretraining has shown great success in learning visual-textual joint representation from web-scale data, demonstrating remarkable "zero-shot" generalization ability for various image tasks. However, how to effectively expand such new language-image pretraining methods to video domains is still an open problem. In this work, we present a simple yet effective approach that adapts the pretrained language-image models to video recognition directly, instead of pretraining a new model from scratch. More concretely, to capture the long-range dependencies of frames along the temporal dimension, we propose a cross-frame attention mechanism that explicitly exchanges information across frames. Such module is lightweight and can be plugged into pretrained language-image models seamlessly. Moreover, we propose a video-specific prompting scheme, which leverages video content information for generating discriminative textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective and can be generalized to different video recognition scenarios. In particular, under fully-supervised settings, our approach achieves a top-1 accuracy of 87.1% on Kinectics-400, while using 12 times fewer FLOPs compared with Swin-L and ViViT-H. In zero-shot experiments, our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods by +7.6% and +14.9% in terms of top-1 accuracy under two popular protocols. In few-shot scenarios, our approach outperforms previous best methods by +32.1% and +23.1% when the labeled data is extremely limited. (Added by Kenneth)

abstract = {Videos naturally contain dynamic variation over the temporal axis, which will result in the same visual clues (e.g., semantics, objects) changing their scale, position, and perspective patterns between adjacent frames. A primary trend in video CNN is adopting spatial-2D convolution for spatial semantics and temporal-1D convolution for temporal dynamics. Though the direction achieves a favorable balance between efficiency and efficacy, it suffers from misalignment of visual clues with large displacements. Particularly, rigid temporal convolution would fail to capture correct motions when a specific target moves out of the reception field of temporal convolution between adjacent frames.To tackle large visual displacements between temporal neighbors, we propose a new temporal convolution namedHourglass Convolution (HgC). The temporal reception field of HgC has an hourglass shape, where the spatial reception field is enlarged in prior \& post temporal frames, enabling an ability to capture large displacement. Moreover, since videos contain long, short-term movements viewed from multiple temporal interval levels, we hierarchically organize the HgC net to both capture temporal dynamics from frame (short-term) and clip (long-term) levels. Besides, we also adopt strategies, such as low-resolution for short-term modeling and channel reduction for long-term modeling, from efficiency concerns. With HgC, our H$^2$CN equips off-the-shelf CNNs with a strong ability in capturing spatio-temporal dynamics at a neglectable computation overhead. We validate the efficiency and efficacy of HgC on standard action recognition benchmarks, including Something-Something V1&V2, Diving48, and EGTEA Gaze+. We also analyse the complementarity of frame-level motion and clip-level motion with visualizations. The code and models will be available at https://github.com/ty-97/H2CN.},

This paper provides a comprehensive review of video classification techniques and the datasets used in this field. We summarize key findings from recent research, focusing on network architectures, model evaluation metrics, and parallel processing methods that enhance training speed. Our review includes an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art deep learning models and hybrid architectures, comparing models to traditional approaches and highlighting their advantages and limitations. Critical challenges such as handling large-scale datasets, improving model robustness, and addressing computational constraints are explored. By evaluating performance metrics, we identify areas where current models excel and where improvements are needed. Additionally, we discuss data augmentation techniques designed to enhance dataset accuracy and address specific challenges in video classification tasks.

The current method for identifying diabetic retinopathy is a time-consuming and manual process, requiring trained medical professionals to examine digital color fundus photographs of the retina and look for the presence of lesions associated with the disease’s vascular abnormalities. Despite technological advancements, accurately identifying the early stages of diabetic retinopathy remains a challenge. To address this issue, different computer vision-based approaches have been introduced to detect DR and classify various stages from retina images. However, these techniques have limited success, particularly in accurately identifying the early stages of the disease. In this study, we employed a publicly available Kaggle Eyepac dataset to train our model for the detection of DR which is known to have ﬁve distinct stages, namely, proliferate DR, severe DR, moderate DR, mild DR, and no DR. The overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score obtained by our proposed model were 88.31± 0.23, 89.15± 0.19, 90.25± 0.41, 89.69±0.25, and 87.38± 1.45 respectively.

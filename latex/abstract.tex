This study compares video and image-based machine learning models for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) classification from CT scan sequences, hypothesizing that incorporating temporal information improves diagnostic accuracy. A video transformer model (ViVit) was compared against a state-of-the-art image-based convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt). ViVit achieved a mean accuracy of 0.72 and recall of 0.62, outperforming ConvNeXt's 0.60 accuracy and 0.13 recall, despite a slightly lower precision (0.73 vs. 0.67). These results highlight the importance of temporal context for ICH classification and the potential of video models in medical imaging. Future work should explore alternative architectures and address data imbalance.

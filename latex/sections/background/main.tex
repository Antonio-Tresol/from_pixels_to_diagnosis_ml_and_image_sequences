In this section we define key background knowledge to understand the study.

% Commented as it is no longer needed
% We begin by defining pertinent medical concepts related to Intracranial hemorrhage, the condition we are trying to automatically classify. Following this, we provide a brief explanation of the architecture and functionality of the video models. Lastly, we describe the process of transfer learning which plays a critical role in our methodology.

Multiview learning is a machine learning technique that uses several data sources (views) to improve generalization in different tasks \cite{multiview_a_surview}. In the context of vision models, multiview models are architectures designed to improve the performance of various vision tasks by utilizing multiple views of an object instead of a single image \cite{multiview_hybrid_fusion_mutual_distill}.

Several approaches have been employed to leverage information from multiple images, with fusion being the most common. View fusion aims to combine information from multiple views into a single, high-dimensional representation that can be used to solve the task. This fusion can occur early or late in the process. Early fusion combines the views at the beginning of the model architecture, processing the fused representation to produce the output. Conversely, late fusion combines the views near the end of the architecture, after each view has been processed separately \cite{multiview_a_surview, multiview_hybrid_fusion_mutual_distill}.

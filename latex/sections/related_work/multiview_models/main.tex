Multiview models have played a significant role in medical imaging, where many screening procedures produce multiple views of the same organ. These models can readily utilize such image sets for various purposes \cite{swint_multiview, hybrid_mammo_net}

To the best of our knowledge, multiview models have been particularly successful advancing the state-of-the-art in breast cancer classification. Notably, Sanker et al. \cite{swint_multiview} recently introduced a novel transform-based two-view model with promising results. Similarly, Allaoui et al. \cite{hybrid_mammo_net} implemented hybrid two-view models combining convolutional and transformer layers.  Black and Souvenir \cite{multiview_hybrid_fusion_mutual_distill} proposed a novel fusion approach, benchmarking their model across medical and non-medical tasks with state-of-the-art results.
